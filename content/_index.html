        <h3>Vision</h3>
        <p>
          “57+ Blocks” is the working name for a strategy aimed at reducing gun
          violence and addressing its harmful impacts on our hardest hit
          neighborhoods through targeted investment of resources, services,
          education, and environmental improvements. This strategy is designed to
          bring non-law enforcement, evidence-based services and improvements to
          the people and places that need them most.

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          In 2021, the Philadelphia Inquirer published <a
           href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/a/philadelphia-shootings-homicides-redlining-kensington-20210916.html"
           target="_blank">"Intersections of Injustice,"</a> an article that
         identified 57 blocks where 10 or more people have been shot since 2015.
         Further, 53 out of 57 of these blocks were historically redlined.
         Inspired by this work, <span class="emphasis">the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office
           (DAO) and community partners launched the 57+ Blocks Coalition, a
           community-led coalition that supports place-based, non-law
           enforcement strategies to reduce gun violence</span> through the
         targeted investment of resources, services, and environmental
         improvements.
        </p>

        <p>
        The initial Inquirer analysis identified 57 Blocks with 10 or more
        shootings since 2015. Approximately 53 out of the 57 identified blocks
        were historically redlined, which was the denial of access to mortgages,
        resulting in strategic disinvestment and cycles of poverty in
        predominantly Black and Latin(x) communities. Building upon these
        findings, the District Attorney’s Transparency Analytics Lab (DATA Lab)
        conducted analyses to identify the locations of shootings and relevant
        case outcomes. Upon expanding on this analysis, the DATA Lab identified
        that there were 89 Blocks with 10 or more shooting victims between
        January 1, 2015, and August 9, 2023.
        </p>

        <p>
        In the last year, the 57+ Blocks working group coordinated a series of
        community conversations across the city of Philadelphia. Throughout
        these community organizing efforts, the 57+ Blocks Coalition has engaged
        hundreds of community members and has grown into a collective of 70+
        community-based organizations from across the city who are invested in
        reducing gun violence through the strategies uplifted by the 57+ Blocks
        Coalition.

          Gun violence is a racial justice issue that heavily impacts Black and
